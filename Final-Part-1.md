# An outline
I am interested in showing the viewer how the climate of the Earth has changed over time and how that change is directly related to the number and size of tropical storms that occur. To do this, I plan to show data related to the number and size of tropical storms that have occurred in the Atlantic Ocean over the year, along with data about the average annual global temperature.
With this data, I plan to create bubble charts for each year of data that allow the viewer to see how the Earthâ€™s climate has changed and how this change has led to a larger number of tropical storms and a higher intensity of storms. 

Set Up: This will be the general bubble charts that draw in the viewer and allow them to play with the data. Here, they will start to see the trends in the data that show an increase in the number of tropical storms and their strength.
Conflict: This trend of increasing average annual global temperature relates to the increase in the number and size of tropical storms. 
Resolution: To take action via donations to environmental nonprofits, further learning about global warming and its effects, and actions the reader can take now to reduce their impact on the environment.
