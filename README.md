# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories With Data at CMU.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how to create unique data visualizations and distill the most important elements of these data visualizations. I also hope to learn more about Github and the technological side of creating these data visualizations.

# About Me
Hello, I am Pierce Mitchell, a current graduate student at the University of Carnegie Mellon. I am in the Master of Arts Management program here at Heinz College, and I am currently an intern at Frick Pittsburgh working in the membership and development department. I am originally from Houston, Texas, and moved to Pittsburgh after I graduated High School to attend the University of Pittsburgh. I came to CMU directly after my undergraduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh, where I studied Art History with minors in Museum Studies and Studio Arts.
