# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories With Data at CMU.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how to create unique data visualizations, and how to distill the most important elements in these data visualizations. I also hope to learn more about Github and the technological side of creating these data visualizations.
